                        I would like to say that the three years at IME were one of the best periods of my life. At IME, it always felt like a family, and another home, which helped me in my academic education. I am thankful to all the staff members of the College for their
                        continuous efforts and assistance. Apart from excellent academic experience, I also gained the benefits of being a part of the Cultural Student body. I cherish every moment spent at IME.

                        The jobs provided are not that great, but good for those who want to work. In this college, scholarships are provided for those who score more than 70% in their 12th board exams. Not great companies come to college for placements, but a good number of
                        students get placed.
